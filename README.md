# ASP.NET Upgrade Sample

This repo contains the legacy eShop sample (from https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopModernizing/tree/main/eShopLegacyMVCSolution/src/eShopLegacyMVC) with a few minor changes to make the csproj not use `<PackageReference>`.

This solution can be used as a starting point for demonstrating upgrading an MVC app to ASP.NET Core.
